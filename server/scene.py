"""Turn an uploaded scene.json into plan geometry the solver can measure.

The walls are chained left to right and unrolled into one coordinate s, the distance along the
chain from the meter (negative to the left). Every straight baseline segment knows its outward
direction from its point order (scene.schema.json: points run left to right as seen from outside,
so outward is the direction turned 90 degrees clockwise viewed from above). Clearances are measured
in plan (x, z) with shapely, so two things close together round an inside corner are close even
when they are far apart in s.

What the capture observed is kept as geometry too. The unobserved part of the outdoor area near the
walls is precomputed once, so "was everything within 3 ft of this footprint seen?" is one distance.

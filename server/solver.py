"""The placement solver: a pure function from a parsed scene and the rules to a result.

It slides the battery footprint along every straight wall segment, runs every check at each start
position, and decides. Every check follows the strict rule (docs/00, Decisions: every check
answers PASS, FAIL or UNSURE): PASS only when the margin is larger than the error, FAIL only when
the value is past the threshold by more than the error, otherwise UNSURE. An area nobody observed
is never a pass.

Start positions are a 2 in grid plus every position where some check can change its outcome (an
opening's clearance edge, a coverage boundary, a ground patch edge), plus the midpoints between
those. A feasible stretch narrower than the grid step is therefore still found (golden test 12).

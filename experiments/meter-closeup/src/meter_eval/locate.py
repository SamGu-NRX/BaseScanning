"""Q4 and Q5: find the meter number among everything Vision reads on a close-up.

Candidates are the digit-bearing tokens of each recognized line plus decoded barcode
payloads. A candidate is right when its core (see `match.core`) equals the labelled number's
core, so "NO. 12345678" and "ABC 123456" count, while a longer string that merely contains
the number, such as a barcode line "*XYZ1234567890…*", does not.

The rules and the ranking were written from the odd-numbered photos only (`--split dev`)
and committed before the even-numbered photos were scored. The held-out set is split by
physical meter, not by photo: a meter with any odd-numbered photo counts as seen by the rules,
so all its photos go to the design side (`meter_splits`).

Writes results/locate.md and results/locate_per_image.csv; raw Vision output stays in the
data directory because it contains meter numbers.
